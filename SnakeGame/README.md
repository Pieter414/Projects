# Snake Game
## Deskripsi
This project means to recreate the classic snake game. The player can control the "snake" that automates going around the screen and eating the blue dot as food to grow. There is also a score and high score counter going to track your score. The player can use the 'up' key, 'down' key, 'left' key, and 'right' key to move the head of the snake. If the snake hits his tail or hits a wall, the game is over and the program tracks this game score and the highest score.
